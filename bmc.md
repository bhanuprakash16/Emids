# Business Model Canvas
A business model canvas is a visual representation of a business model, highlighting all key strategic factors. In other words, it is a general, holistic and
complete overview of the company's workings, customers, revenue streams and more. The actual business model canvas definition was first proposed by Alexander 
Osterwalder, a Swiss entrepreneur, and consultant, but has gone to be used around the world.
# What's the Purpose of a Business Model Canvas?
Other than providing a general overview of the business model, these canvases enable companies to visualize and analyze their strategy. This includes updating 
the model as the company evolves, such as changes in the market, new streams or expansions.
The business model canvas provides the central, common source of knowledge through which each department can add their unique input from their respective
domains.
It is a template that defines the business - specifically, how each section interacts with the others. For example, understanding the value proposition, the target customer and the channels through which they are engaged all need to be analyzed together, not just in individual vacuums.
