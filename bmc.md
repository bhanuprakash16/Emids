. It is focused. Enterprises need a definitionof how to get their products to their customers and the business model canvas helps you define them. It also gives you the comptetive edge to launch a profitable business not only through product innovation but also through designing your business correctly.
. BMC is clear and concise. It helps you document your startup journey so you can easily modify it as you go along. The business model is a blueprint that defines your business initially and you later expand on it. It is useful for easy communication with your team, investors, partners as well as employees to come on board with your vision.
. It targets customers needs. The biggest reason for startup failure is "Product/Market fit" and not the product itself. Too often we forget this and direct our energy on building an awesome product. When you envision how you will sell your product, what type of resources you need the different customer segments as well you can serve, the business becomes lucid. Documenting it gives you the clarity when you talk to your customers.
. It reduces the risk of failure. The business model canvas helps you with the execution steps requirement to take your idea to market. Connecting the dots between your value proposition + customer segments + revenue streams, is a good input to your marketing strategy, positioning statement as well as your sales strategy. You have the edge over your competitors who are immersed in the lengthy pages of the business plan.
. It is a scientific framework that works. Business model canvas is a tried and tested methodology not only for startups but also for innovating in large enterprises. Nespresso, a fully owned daughter company of NestL. is a great example of a powerful business model.It changed the face of the coffee industry by turning a transactional business (selling coffee through retail) into one with recurring revenues (selling proprietary pods through direct channels).
