# Business Model Canvas
A business model canvas is a visual representation of a business model, highlighting all key strategic factors. In other words, it is a general, holistic and
complete overview of the company's workings, customers, revenue streams and more. The actual business model canvas definition was first proposed by Alexander 
Osterwalder, a Swiss entrepreneur, and consultant, but has gone to be used around the world.

# What's the Purpose of a Business Model Canvas?
Other than providing a general overview of the business model, these canvases enable companies to visualize and analyze their strategy. This includes updating 
the model as the company evolves, such as changes in the market, new streams or expansions.
The business model canvas provides the central, common source of knowledge through which each department can add their unique input from their respective
domains.
It is a template that defines the business - specifically, how each section interacts with the others. For example, understanding the value proposition, the target customer and the channels through which they are engaged all need to be analyzed together, not just in individual vacuums.
Alternatively, the business model canvas can be used by organizations to plan, assess or execute new models altogether. In this way, the canvas highlights the key essentials and ensures that no vital factors are forgotten. If the canvas is incomplete, then the respective strategy is also incomplete.

# Elements of a Business Model Canvas
# Customer Segments
Whether its B2B or B2C, all businesses have customers. These are the people or organizations that buy your products, use your service or are otherwise essentail for creating a profit.
Customers can be defined through various but it's important to focus on the core customers first, then assess less critical or potential future clients. The canvas should assess, among other factors:
. Current and future needs: What are customers looking for, and what might they be looking for in the immmediate future?
. General demographic: age range, location, interests, etc.,
. Likes, dislikes and pain points: What do your customers enjoy and what puts them off? Knowing this will help understand how best to approach them.
. Relations with other segments: This is important if your business relies on multiple groups interacting. Airbnb, for example, has both property owners and guests - the business strategy only works if both are satisfied.
Additionally, you can list additional segments that may utilize the product or service in the future. This will highlight future directions the strategy can go in, once success has bee gained with the core, primary audience(s).
# Value Proposition
A company's value proposition is the sum of its various products and services, specifically in reagards to how it uniquely stands out amongst the competition. In layman's terms: what is the unique factor that makes this business better than another?
The creator of the business model canvas, Osterwalder has also stated that organizations need to offer something unique and, what's more, this needs to be immediately discernbile from the competition.
